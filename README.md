# 🔍 Computer Vision: Image Similarity Search

This project demonstrates **image similarity search** using **computer vision** and **neural network embeddings** in Python (Google Colab).

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The notebook shows how to:
- Extract image embeddings using pre-trained neural networks.
- Compare and find similar images via vector distance (e.g., cosine similarity).
- Visualize search results directly in Colab.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- **Feature extraction** with deep learning models
- **Vectorization** and **similarity metrics**
- **Practical use case**: find similar images from a dataset

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch / TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab
